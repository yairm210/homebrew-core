  # livecheck needs to surface multiple versions for version throttling but
  # there are thousands of renovate releases on npm. The package page showing
  # versions is several MB in size (and the registry response is 10x that),
  # so curl can time out before the response finishes. This checks releases on
  # GitHub as a workaround, as it provides information on multiple versions
  # but has a much smaller size.
